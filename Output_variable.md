# Output Variable
In this section, we will be discussing an output variable for the analysis of the study,
which help us to give a sort of an answer about the data we're processing.

## Selected output
Instinctively, the output is going to be wether the person has obesity or not, but because of the data we have,
we know that variable it's divided in different categories such as, normal weight, overweight, obesity 1, 2, etc.

It is very helpful to not have a very polarized answer, due to the overwealming reaction it could have 
on someone, for instance, is better to use categories instead an output of (yes/no), to the obesity question.

## Nature of the variable
The nature of the variable, or the type of variable, would be categoric, which is more suitable than using a number as an output.

The levels of obesity are the following: 

- Insufficient Weight

- Normal Weight

- Overweight Level I

- Overweight Level II 

- Obesity Type I 

- Obesity Type II 

- Obesity Type III

These types of variables will be the result for the answer of what type of obesity someone has, based on the physical 
characteristics and eating habits presented in the data set.

Since we are dealing with categories, we won't be calculating averages (you can't calculate the "average" of a category). Instead, the analysis will focus on:

The Counts: How many people are in each group?

The Percentages: What portion of the total population falls into "Normal Weight" vs. "Obesity Type I"?

The Most Common Group: Which level appears the most in our data?
