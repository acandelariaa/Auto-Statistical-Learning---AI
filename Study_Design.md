# Study Design
In this section, we discuss how the dataset is composed, specifically focusing on the variables available. From a constructive perspective, as mentioned before, the dataset is very basic. Therefore, to generate accurate outputs regarding obesity, health issues, or other related outcomes, additional variables need to be considered.

There are numerous variables relevant to analyzing obesity, such as the time dedicated to physical exercise, engagement in regular physical activity, hours spent sitting per day, and other lifestyle-related factors. Among these, variables related to physical activity stand out intuitively, as exercise is closely linked to energy expenditure and overall health.

# Science Related Facts
Scientific research consistently highlights that physical activity and exercise play a crucial role in body weight regulation and obesity levels. Regular exercise increases energy expenditure, helps reduce body fat, and decreases the risk of obesity and other health issues.

An article published by **Clinical Medicine**, the official journal of the *Royal College of Physicians* (London), encouraged the adoption of recurrent physical activity due to its benefits and the reduction of health issues associated with fitness.

Consequently, we propose an additional variable named **"Physical Activity"** (or "Actividad Física"). This variable holds significant importance for the analysis and could be treated as qualitative (Active/Normal/Low) or quantitative (hours per week).
