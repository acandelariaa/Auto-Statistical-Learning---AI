# Graphic Analysis: Focus on Male Subpopulation

For this section, we have selected the **male subpopulation** to analyze the relationship between our output variable (Obesity Level) and a key quantitative variable: **Weight**. To provide a complete perspective on the behavior of this subpopulation, we have visualized it alongside the female distribution for context.

Given the high variability in individual weight, we calculated the **average weight** for each obesity category. This allows us to identify clear trends and patterns without the noise of individual data points.

**Interpretation of Results:**

**Subpopulation Selection:** Both genders, males and females, were selected for this visualization to facilitate clear interpretation of the results. Since the main objective is to perform a comparative analysis, this plot allows us to contrast the average weight between genders across every level of obesity. This comparative approach provides valuable context that looking at a single subpopulation would miss.

The chart reveals a consistent pattern: the male subpopulation exhibits a higher average weight across every obesity category compared to the female baseline. Initially, this difference is stable, hovering around 10 kg for the first several categories.

However, a **striking distinction** appears in the "Obesity Type III" category. Here, the average weight for men surges to approximately 173 kg, creating a massive gap of over 50 kg compared to women in the same category.

This suggests that while biological factors (such as muscle mass and bone density) explain the consistent moderate difference in lower levels, the **Obesity Type III** classification in men represents an extreme outlier group with significantly higher body mass requirements than their female counterparts.

## Conclusion
The nature of the dataset is qualitative and quantitative, also, the variables we have seem to be basic and subjective, which for general data analysis is very good, but for professional data processing tend to be difficult to reach a solid conclusion due to other missing factors such as, specific diet, excercise, sleep quality, active lifestyle.

Also, the dataset, should need to be more specific in things like, "ConsumoDeAgua", "ComeVegetales", due to the lack of measure units or frequency specification for these variables.

Overall, as mentioned before, this dataset serves as an excellent example for Auto-Statistical Learning data processing, as it clearly demonstrates how distinct variables can influence a categorical outcome
