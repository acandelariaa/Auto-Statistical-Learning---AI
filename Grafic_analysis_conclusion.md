# Grafic Analysis
Now, we've been exploring the dataset and proposing some output variables, now let's explore a
sub population and compare the output variable, against a variable of our choice,
think of something highly related to obesity, like weight, let's compare that to the output.

Due to the high variety of weight for each person, we need to find the average 
weight for every type of obesity and plot the results to see if there is a pattern, 
which can be used later to make some inferences about males and females.
